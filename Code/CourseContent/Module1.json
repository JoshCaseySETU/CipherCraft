Its roots can be traced to the ancient Greeks, who were known for their contributions to mathematics and cryptography. The name 'Rail Fence' originates from the visual resemblance of the encryption process to the pattern of a fence. This cipher falls under the category of transposition ciphers, which involve rearranging the order of characters in the plaintext without altering their identities. Unlike substitution ciphers, which replace each character with another, transposition ciphers like the Fence Cipher operate by changing the sequence of characters.",

This process ensures that the original message is obscured and can only be deciphered by someone with knowledge of the key and encryption method.",

Additionally, the emergence of quantum computers poses a potential threat to the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange, as it could potentially render the discrete logarithm problem trivial to solve. To address these challenges, ongoing research focuses on developing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks, ensuring the long-term security of communication systems."

Additionally, CBC mode incorporates feedback from previous ciphertext blocks into the encryption of each subsequent block, adding an element of diffusion and ensuring that small changes in the plaintext propagate unpredictably throughout the ciphertext.
